            <article>
                <p>
                    One of the concering topics in web developing fields is the size of elements in styling. How size
                    is measured in css styling, and its relation with the physical device size is a little bit confusing.
                    Width and height is measured in css pixel that has a suffix PX in styling. The physical device or the
                    browser width is also measured in pixel. so, the question is, are they the same measurement scales?
                </p>
                <p>
                   when pixels are used to specify a width of an element, it has some issues concerned with screen sizes.
                   pixel measurement is static does not change with different screen size. So, user interaction on different
                   devices become more difficult to manage. The most priorety in web developing is given to user satisfaction.
                   Using pixels are not recommended for width value. Inorder to solve this problems relative size are the
                   best choices. There are different relative size measurements (em, rem, %). em is font size relative to the
                   container of the element. rem is font size relative to the viewport of the device. percent means width or 
                   height of the viewport expression. All three relative size are not static as pixel, they change with the
                   device screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                   when em is used as relative font size for an element, the font size get larger if the em is greater than One
                   otherwise is dimenished relative to the container element font size. Although, rem is not dependent on the 
                   container that is holding the element. It is only relative to the browser font size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The percent relative size measurement is for width and height of the element. The size is relative to the 
                    element that holds it. So, if body width is set to 900px and section inside the body given eighty percent
                    width value the section width in pixel is going to be seven hundred twenty pixels. when the zoom is hundred
                    percent the css pixel and device pixels are the same. If user zoomed in the css pixel overlaps several 
                    device pixles. Also, user zooming out the device pixel overlaps several pixels of css.

            <article>
                <p>
                    First of all what does it means font size? <br>
                    Font size css property denotes that a font is allocated the amount of space specified; it does not have to 
                    have to make use of all of this allocated space. This space is the distance between the top of the tallest
                    character to the bottom of the descender. The browser sixteen pixel means it is the default height of a
                    single character. A css font size property value of 200px means the character in that element tag is going
                    to have a height of 200px. Although the height is not exactly 200px, the calculation of the distance dose 
                    not includ the descender part. Which means the height is going to be shorter than 200px.
